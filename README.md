# Project Todos
A Todo app built with React and Redux to practice working with the Redux store, creating reducers, and actions.

# Project Requirements
* The app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted.
* The app should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).
* The app should be able to add and remove tasks.
* The app should show a count of either all todos or all uncompleted todos (or both).
